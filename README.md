# NLP-Notes
NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a part of Computer Science, Human language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyse, manipulate, and interpret humanâ€™s languages. NLP has many applications in various fields and domains, such as translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, text generation, and more.

NLP consists of two main components: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG). NLU is the process of extracting meaning and information from natural language input, such as text or speech. NLG is the process of producing natural language output from structured or unstructured data, such as facts or concepts.

NLP involves various tasks and subfields, such as syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse, morphology, phonology, and lexicon. Each of these subfields deals with different aspects of natural language, such as structure, meaning, context, function, and sound.
